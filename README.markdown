#toddeman.com sandbox rails project

this is the rails project for [toddeman.com](www.toddeman.com). it aim
to accomplish the following:

- learn rails through a simple sandbox project
- get the project on heroku first
- point the toddeman.com domain to the project
- use the project as both a sandbox and a lauch site for 
other projects of mine.
