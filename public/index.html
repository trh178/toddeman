		that it IS set up, its one of the best distros ive used yet. read more for my explaination why, as

		this site is running on rails so to speak. it is my first foreaux (spelling?) into ruby on rails. it
		has been fun thus far (enforcing the slogan i have heard before 'ruby: make coding fun again') and
		also has made deployment a snap (again, enforcing the slogan 'rails: from 0 - deploy in X minutes).
		read more to check out the process as well as some tips and tricks ive picked up in my (extremely)
		limited experience thus far.
